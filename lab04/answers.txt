- What is the value of SQLAlchemy?
SQLAlchemy is (sometimes) easier to use when working with databases as it is in python. It also
uses the same commands for many SQL-based databases. Therefore, if you ever need to change databases
the SQLAlchemy commands will still work.

- What is a model?
Models are user-defined Python classes and objects that are associated with database tables.

- What is a view?
Views are the API endpoints that allow other clients to interact with our database in a structured manner.
For example, it can define the GET method and the JSON container that it returns.
